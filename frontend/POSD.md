# Applying "A Philosophy of Software Design" Principles

This document outlines how the SCANUEV project applies the principles from "A Philosophy of Software Design" by John Ousterhout.

## Complexity Management

The `ChatInterfaceClient` component manages complexity by breaking down functionality into smaller, manageable pieces and using hooks for state management.

## Deep Modules

The `ChatService` class provides a simple interface while hiding complex implementation details, demonstrating the principle of deep modules.

## Information Hiding

The `AgentConfigService` module encapsulates agent-specific configurations, hiding implementation details and providing a clean interface.

## Error Handling

The project centralizes error handling, providing meaningful error messages and using constants for error messages.

## Separation of Concerns

The project structure demonstrates good separation of concerns, with clear distinctions between components, hooks, services, and utilities.

## Reusable Components

UI components are designed to be reusable and modular, promoting code reuse and consistency across the application.

## Comments and Documentation

The codebase uses JSDoc comments and markdown documentation to provide clear explanations of functionality, parameters, and return values.
